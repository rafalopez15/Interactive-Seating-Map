### Program Description
This system contains a seating arrangement for 3 types of events: 
- Movie
- Game
- Conert
These three events contain different seating arrangements at different prices.
The user can choose as many seats as they like and it will be added to their order. 
The user can mark a check box if they are a VIP customer and a discount will be added to their order.
If a user chooses more than 5 seats a bulk discount will be applied.
